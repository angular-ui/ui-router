<div class="description"><div class="-rootscope-page -rootscope-inprog-page"><p>At any point in time there can be only one <code>$digest</code> or $apply operation in progress.
The stack trace of this error allows you to trace the origin of the currently executing $apply or $digest call.</p>
<p><code>$digest</code> or <code>$apply</code> are processing operational states of the Scope - data-structure in Angular that provides context for models and enables model mutation observation.</p>
<p>Trying to reenter a <code>$digest</code> or <code>$apply</code> while one of them is already in progress is typically a sign of programming error that needs to be fixed.</p>
<p>This error is often seen when interacting with an API that is sometimes sync and sometimes async.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>function MyController() {
  thirdPartyComponent.getData(function(someData) {
    scope.$apply(function() {
      scope.someData = someData;
    });
  });
}</code></pre>
<p>The controller constructor is always instantiated from within an $apply cycle, so if the third-party component called our callback synchronously, we&#39;d be trying to enter the $apply again.</p>
<p>To resolve this type of issue, either fix the api to be always synchronous or asynchronous or wrap the call to the api with setTimeout call to make it always asynchronous.</p>
<p>Other situation that leads to this error is when you are trying to reuse a function to by using it as a callback for code that is called by various apis inside and outside of $apply.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>myApp.directive(&#39;myDirective&#39;, function() {
  return {
    link: function($scope, $element) {
      function doSomeWork() {
        $scope.$apply(function() {
           // do work here, and update the model
        };
      }

      $element.on(&#39;click&#39;, doSomeWork);
      doSomeWork(); // &lt;&lt; this will throw an exception because templates are compiled within $apply
    }
  }
});</code></pre>
<p>The fix for the example above looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>myApp.directive(&#39;myDirective&#39;, function() {
  return {
    link: function($scope, $element) {
      function doSomeWork() {
           // do work here, and update the model
      }

      $element.on(&#39;click&#39;, function() {
        $scope.$apply(doSomeWork); // &lt;&lt;&lt; the $apply call was moved to the callsite that doesn&#39;t execute in $apply call already
      });

      doSomeWork();
    }
  }
});</code></pre>
