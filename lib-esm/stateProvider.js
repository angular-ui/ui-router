 * The Angular 1 `StateProvider`
 *
 * The `$stateProvider` works similar to Angular's v1 router, but it focuses purely
 * on state.
 *
 * A state corresponds to a "place" in the application in terms of the overall UI and
 * navigation. A state describes (via the controller / template / view properties) what
 * the UI looks like and does at that place.
 *
 * States often have things in common, and the primary way of factoring out these
 * commonalities in this model is via the state hierarchy, i.e. parent/child states aka
 * nested states.
 *
 * The `$stateProvider` provides interfaces to declare these states for your app.

     * Decorates states when they are registered
     *
     * Allows you to extend (carefully) or override (at your own peril) the
     * `stateBuilder` object used internally by [[StateRegistry]].
     * This can be used to add custom functionality to ui-router,
     * for example inferring templateUrl based on the state name.
     *
     * When passing only a name, it returns the current (original or decorated) builder
     * function that matches `name`.
     *
     * The builder functions that can be decorated are listed below. Though not all
     * necessarily have a good use case for decoration, that is up to you to decide.
     *
     * In addition, users can attach custom decorators, which will generate new
     * properties within the state's internal definition. There is currently no clear
     * use-case for this beyond accessing internal states (i.e. $state.$current),
     * however, expect this to become increasingly relevant as we introduce additional
     * meta-programming features.
     *
     * **Warning**: Decorators should not be interdependent because the order of
     * execution of the builder functions in non-deterministic. Builder functions
     * should only be dependent on the state definition object and super function.
     *
     *
     * Existing builder functions and current return values:
     *
     * - **parent** `{object}` - returns the parent state object.
     * - **data** `{object}` - returns state data, including any inherited data that is not
     *   overridden by own values (if any).
     * - **url** `{object}` - returns a {@link ui.router.util.type:UrlMatcher UrlMatcher}
     *   or `null`.
     * - **navigable** `{object}` - returns closest ancestor state that has a URL (aka is
     *   navigable).
     * - **params** `{object}` - returns an array of state params that are ensured to
     *   be a super-set of parent's params.
     * - **views** `{object}` - returns a views object where each key is an absolute view
     *   name (i.e. "viewName@stateName") and each value is the config object
     *   (template, controller) for the view. Even when you don't use the views object
     *   explicitly on a state config, one is still created for you internally.
     *   So by decorating this builder function you have access to decorating template
     *   and controller properties.
     * - **ownParams** `{object}` - returns an array of params that belong to the state,
     *   not including any params defined by ancestor states.
     * - **path** `{string}` - returns the full path from the root down to this state.
     *   Needed for state activation.
     * - **includes** `{object}` - returns an object that includes every state that
     *   would pass a `$state.includes()` test.
     *
     * #### Example:
     * Override the internal 'views' builder with a function that takes the state
     * definition, and a reference to the internal function being overridden:
     * ```js
     * $stateProvider.decorator('views', function (state, parent) {
     *   let result = {},
     *       views = parent(state);
     *
     *   angular.forEach(views, function (config, name) {
     *     let autoName = (state.name + '.' + name).replace('.', '/');
     *     config.templateUrl = config.templateUrl || '/partials/' + autoName + '.html';
     *     result[name] = config;
     *   });
     *   return result;
     * });
     *
     * $stateProvider.state('home', {
     *   views: {
     *     'contact.list': { controller: 'ListController' },
     *     'contact.item': { controller: 'ItemController' }
     *   }
     * });
     * ```
     *
     *
     * ```js
     * // Auto-populates list and item views with /partials/home/contact/list.html,
     * // and /partials/home/contact/item.html, respectively.
     * $state.go('home');
     * ```
     *
     * @param {string} name The name of the builder function to decorate.
     * @param {object} func A function that is responsible for decorating the original
     * builder function. The function receives two parameters:
     *
     *   - `{object}` - state - The state config object.
     *   - `{object}` - super - The original builder function.
     *
     * @return {object} $stateProvider - $stateProvider instance
