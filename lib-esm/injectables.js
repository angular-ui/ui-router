/**
 * # Angular 1 injectable services
 *
 * This is a list of the objects which can be injected using angular's injector.
 *
 * There are three different kind of injectable objects:
 *
 * ## **Provider** objects
 * #### injectable into a `.config()` block during configtime
 *
 * - [[$uiRouterProvider]]: The UI-Router instance
 * - [[$stateProvider]]: State registration
 * - [[$transitionsProvider]]: Transition hooks
 * - [[$urlServiceProvider]]: All URL related public APIs
 *
 * - [[$uiViewScrollProvider]]: Disable ui-router view scrolling
 * - [[$urlRouterProvider]]: (deprecated) Url matching rules
 * - [[$urlMatcherFactoryProvider]]: (deprecated) Url parsing config
 *
 * ## **Service** objects
 * #### injectable globally during runtime
 *
 * - [[$uiRouter]]: The UI-Router instance
 * - [[$trace]]: Enable transition trace/debug
 * - [[$transitions]]: Transition hooks
 * - [[$state]]: Imperative state related APIs
 * - [[$stateRegistry]]: State registration
 * - [[$urlService]]: All URL related public APIs
 * - [[$uiRouterGlobals]]: Global variables
 * - [[$uiViewScroll]]: Scroll an element into view
 *
 * - [[$stateParams]]: (deprecated) Global state param values
 * - [[$urlRouter]]: (deprecated) URL synchronization
 * - [[$urlMatcherFactory]]: (deprecated) URL parsing config
 *
 * ## **Per-Transition** objects
 *
 * - These kind of objects are injectable into:
 *   - Resolves ([[Ng1StateDeclaration.resolve]]),
 *   - Transition Hooks ([[TransitionService.onStart]], etc),
 *   - Routed Controllers ([[Ng1ViewDeclaration.controller]])
 *
 * #### Different instances are injected based on the [[Transition]]
 *
 * - [[$transition$]]: The current Transition object
 * - [[$stateParams]]: State param values for pending Transition (deprecated)
 * - Any resolve data defined using [[Ng1StateDeclaration.resolve]]
 *
 * @ng1api
 * @preferred
 * @module injectables

/**
 * The current (or pending) State Parameters
 *
 * An injectable global **Service Object** which holds the state parameters for the latest **SUCCESSFUL** transition.
 *
 * The values are not updated until *after* a `Transition` successfully completes.
 *
 * **Also:** an injectable **Per-Transition Object** object which holds the pending state parameters for the pending `Transition` currently running.
 *
 * ### Deprecation warning:
 *
 * The value injected for `$stateParams` is different depending on where it is injected.
 *
 * - When injected into an angular service, the object injected is the global **Service Object** with the parameter values for the latest successful `Transition`.
 * - When injected into transition hooks, resolves, or view controllers, the object is the **Per-Transition Object** with the parameter values for the running `Transition`.
 *
 * Because of these confusing details, this service is deprecated.
 *
 * ### Instead of using the global `$stateParams` service object,
 * inject [[$uiRouterGlobals]] and use [[UIRouterGlobals.params]]
 *
 * ```js
 * MyService.$inject = ['$uiRouterGlobals'];
 * function MyService($uiRouterGlobals) {
 *   return {
 *     paramValues: function () {
 *       return $uiRouterGlobals.params;
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Instead of using the per-transition `$stateParams` object,
 * inject the current `Transition` (as [[$transition$]]) and use [[Transition.params]]
 *
 * ```js
 * MyController.$inject = ['$transition$'];
 * function MyController($transition$) {
 *   var username = $transition$.params().username;
 *   // .. do something with username
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ---
 *
 * This object can be injected into other services.
 *
 * #### Deprecated Example:
 * ```js
 * SomeService.$inject = ['$http', '$stateParams'];
 * function SomeService($http, $stateParams) {
 *   return {
 *     getUser: function() {
 *       return $http.get('/api/users/' + $stateParams.username);
 *     }
 *   }
 * };
 * angular.service('SomeService', SomeService);
 * ```
 * @deprecated
